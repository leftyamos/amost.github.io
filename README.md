# Data Science portfolio by Amos Tai

A portfolio that contains a compilation of projects that I created which utilises the fundamentals of data analysis, machine learning, deep learning and digital signal processing. Most of the projects are made using the Python programming language. 


Rhode Island Police Activity
This project is a data visualization project that explores the police activities in Rhode Island using various EDA methods to visualize the different types of violations committed based on race, gender, time of day and other related variables.

Sonar
The dataset is taken to UCI Machine Learning Repository where the goal is to differentiate between a metal cylinder and a cylindrical rock based of the sonar signals bouncing off of them. This project uses deep learning models to classify the two different types through the use of Keras.

Music Genre Classification
Music Genre Classification uses Librosa which is an audio and music analysis python library. This project classified the genre of music based on their properties by using different types of machine learning and deep learning models created.

Fruit
A simple dataset of fruits was analyze and used as a classification problem by using different machine learning models.

Yelp Ratings
A NLP project which analyze yelp reviews and predict them as either positive or negative ratings.

Twitter
A NLP project which analyze a set of twitter tweets to determine if is it a disaster event or not by using various machine learning models.

Wheat Kernel Seeds
Wheat Kernel Seeds uses a dataset taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository where it is analyze and train using multiple machine learning models to classify different types of seeds.

Student Performance Grade
This dataset is taken from XXX where it shows the performance grades of students based on various variables. The dataset is analyzed and train to use as a Feature Selection problem.

Wine Classification and Quality Prediction
This project analyzes the quality of red and white wine based on various variables. It is then train using different types of machine learning models as well as deep learning models.
