# Data Science Portfolio by Amos Tai

A portfolio that contains a compilation of projects that I created which utilises the fundamentals of data analysis, machine learning, deep learning and digital signal processing. Most of the projects are made using the Python programming language. 


### Rhode Island Police Activity
This [project](https://github.com/leftyamos/amost.github.io/blob/master/Analyzing_Rhode_Island_Police_Activity.ipynb) is a data visualization project that explores the police activities in Rhode Island using various EDA methods to visualize the different types of violations committed based on race, gender, time of day and other related variables.

### Metal & Rocks Classification (Binary)
The dataset is taken to UCI Machine Learning Repository where the goal is to differentiate between a metal cylinder and a cylindrical rock based of the sonar signals bouncing off of them. This [project](https://github.com/leftyamos/amost.github.io/blob/master/Mines%20%26%20Rocks.ipynb) uses various machine learning methods to model and classify the two different types. 
The dataset was also applied to a neural network model in [Keras](https://github.com/leftyamos/amost.github.io/blob/master/Keras_Binary_Classification.ipynb) with its performance evaluated with different models.

### Music Genre Classification (Multi-Class)
Music Genre Classification uses Librosa which is an audio and music analysis python library. This [project](https://github.com/leftyamos/amost.github.io/blob/master/Librosa_Music_Classification.ipynb) classified the genre of music based on their properties by using different types of machine learning and deep learning models created.

### Fruit Classification (Multi-Class)
A simple dataset of fruits was analyze and used as a [classification problem](https://github.com/leftyamos/amost.github.io/blob/master/ML_Multi_Class_Classification.ipynb) by using different machine learning models.

### Wheat Kernel Seeds Classification (Multi-Class)
[Wheat Kernel Seeds](https://github.com/leftyamos/amost.github.io/blob/master/Seed_Multi_Class_Classification.ipynb) uses a dataset taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository where it is analyze and train using multiple machine learning models to classify different types of seeds.

### Student Performance Grade
This dataset is taken from student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools where it shows the performance grades of students based on various variables. The dataset is analyzed and train to use as a [Feature Selection problem](https://github.com/leftyamos/amost.github.io/blob/master/Student%20Performance%20Grade.ipynb).

### Wine Classification and Quality Prediction
This [project](https://github.com/leftyamos/amost.github.io/blob/master/Wine_Classification_%26_Quality_Prediction.ipynb) analyzes the quality of red and white wine based on various variables. It is then train using different types of machine learning models as well as deep learning models.

### Yelp Ratings
A NLP [project](https://github.com/leftyamos/amost.github.io/blob/master/NLP_Classification_Yelp.ipynb) which analyze yelp reviews and predict them as either positive or negative ratings.

### Twitter Disaster Tweets
A NLP [project](https://github.com/leftyamos/amost.github.io/blob/master/NLP_Twitter_Project.ipynb) which analyzes a set of twitter tweets to predict which tweets are about a real disaster by using various machine learning models.


## Kaggle Competition
